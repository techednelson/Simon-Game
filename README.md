Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
